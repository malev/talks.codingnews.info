# Mozfest 2014

## PirateBox hands on v2.0

### What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do? *

It will allow the people to familiarize with the project PirateBox. It will allow people to actually play with one and discover how to hack it and how to enjoy it.

### How do you see that working? *

No more that 15 minutes to describe the project. A little bit about the spin off projects (LibraryBox and maybe something about the OpenWireless Movement). And we will start hacking with some pirateboxes I'll bring with two options: trying to accomplish some configuration tasks or trying to innovate with new alternative uses of the piratebox.

### How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? *

I'm thinking on splitting on groups no more that 4 people. And since I'll bring my own devices, the limit will be given by the amount of devices I'll be able to carry.

### What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?

I hope to engage more people with the project, the let them familiarized with the technology and maybe to come out with new potencial uses.

## Process in a news room. How do you meet your deadlines?

### What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?

This session is designed for journalists, designers or developers who works in news room or people interested in learning about different process while developing software.
In this session people will learn about traditional developing process like Scrum, Kanban, Rup or Waterfall.
We will also learn and discuss how are newsrooms solving this problems and how do they function in environments covered with breaking news and hard limits.

### How do you see that working?

I plan to invite people who works in different news rooms so people can share their experiences, discuss problematics and compare alternatives. We are also going to compare the main differences between working in a news room and working on a traditional software company.

### How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?

If we have 5 participants we will discuss between us. If we have more than eight we will split into groups and we will have a conclusion plenary at the end.

### What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?

I expect to write a blog post about different ways of handling software process in news rooms. I also expect people to take the discussion or debate to their own newsrooms so in case they need, they can improve they way they are working. Or at least talk about it.

## Beyond scraping

### What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?

I expect people to leave the room knowing how to scrape a website with basic tools or, for the more advance participants, to know what do you need to have in mind when scraping a website. What other steps you need to do or what need of cautions you need to take.

### How do you see that working?

We're planning on provide a short description / introduction and then splitting the crowd in groups taking in consideration whether they have past experienced with scraping or not. Then we will provide a set of prefixed tasks to do on their computers. The tasks will be divided on level of difficult. Lastly we will walk around the groups to help them move across the steps.
To download any necessarily software we will use a PirateBox with the most common libraries.

### How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?

We will split into groups.

### What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?

We hope to find gaps on the available tools whether they are for hardcore users or for newcomers. And we expect from our assistants to have a new lever of understanding of the problem.
